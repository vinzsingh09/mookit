			<p>
				The first suggestion that all organisms may have had a common ancestor and diverged
				through random variation and natural selection was made in 1745 by the French
				mathematician and scientist Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698-1759) in his work
				Venus physique. Specifically:

			<p>
				All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organisation:
				genetic information encoded in DNA, transcribed into RNA, through the effect of
				protein- and RNA-enzymes, then translated into proteins by (highly similar)
				ribosomes, with ATP, NADH and others as energy currencies, etc. Furthermore, the
				genetic code (the "translation table" according to which DNA information is
				translated into proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from bacteria
				to humans, with minor local differences. The universality of this code is generally
				regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal
				common descent. Analysis of the small differences in the genetic code has also
				provided support for universal common descent.[2]

			<h4>
				Artificial selection
			</h4>
			<p>
				Artificial selection offers remarkable examples of the amount of diversity that can
				exist between individuals sharing a late common ancestor. To perform artificial
				selection, one begins with a particular species (following examples include wolves
				and wild cabbage) and then, at every generation, only allow certain individuals to
				reproduce, based on the degree to which they exhibit certain desirable
				characteristics. In time, it is expected that these characteristics become
				increasingly well-developed in successive generations. Many examples of artificial
				selection, like the ones below, occurred without the guidance of modern scientific
				insight.
